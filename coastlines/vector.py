    Prepares and preprocesses DE Africa Coastlines raster data to

    3) Computes an all-time coastal mask based on the observed timeseries

    Parameters:

    yearly_ds : xarray.Dataset
        An `xarray.Dataset` containing annual DE Africa Coastlines rasters.
    gapfill_ds : xarray.Dataset
        An `xarray.Dataset` containing three-year gapfill DE Africa Coastlines
        rasters.
    water_index : string
        A string giving the name of the water index included in the

    index_threshold : float
        A float giving the water index threshold used to separate land
        and water (e.g. 0.00).
    tide_points_gdf : geopandas.GeoDataFrame
        Spatial points located within the ocean. These points are used
        by the `mask_ocean` to ensure that all coastlines are directly
        connected to the ocean. These may be obtained from the tidal
        modelling points used in the raster generation part of the DE
        Africa CoastLines analysis, as these are guaranteed to be
        located in coastal or marine waters.
    buffer_pixels : int, optional
        The number of pixels by which to buffer the all time shoreline
        detected by this function to produce an overall coastal buffer.
        The default is 33 pixels, which at 30 m Landsat resolution
        produces a coastal buffer with a radius of approximately 1000 m.
    mask_landcover : bool, optional
        Whether to apply a mask derived from the ESA World Cover dataset
        to flag deep water pixels as water before computing the all-time
        coastal mask. This can help remove aerosol-based noise over open
        water in USGS Collection 2 Level 2 data. Defaults to True.
    mask_ndwi : bool, optional
        Whether to apply an additional mask based on the Normalised
        Difference Water Index (NDWI) to flag pixels with high water
        values as water. This can help reduce aerosol-based noise over
        open water in USGS Collection 2 Level 2 data, as NDWI is less
        impacted by this than MNDWI. Defaults to True.
    mask_temporal : bool, optional
        Whether to apply a temporal contiguity mask by identifying land
        pixels with a direct spatial connection (e.g. contiguous) to
        land pixels in either the previous or subsequent timestep. This is
        used to clean up noisy land pixels (e.g. caused by clouds,
        white water, sensor issues), as these pixels typically occur
        randomly with no relationship to the distribution of land in
        neighbouring timesteps. True land, however, is likely to appear
        in proximity to land before or after the specific timestep.
        Defaults to True.
    mask_modifications : geopandas.GeoDataFrame, optional
        An optional polygon dataset including features to remove or add
        to the all-time coastal mask. This should include a column/field
        named 'type' that contains two possible values:
            - 'add': features to add to the coastal mask (e.g. for
                     including areas of missing shorelines that were
                     previously removed by the coastal mask)
            - 'remove': features to remove from the coastal mask (e.g.
                        areas of non-coastal rivers or estuaries,
                        irrigated fields or aquaculture that you wish
                        to exclude from the analysis)

    masked_ds : xarray.Dataset
        A dataset containing water index data for each annual timestep

    certainty_masks : dict
        A dictionary containg one `geopandas.GeoDataFrame` for each year
